# leettomato

some little apps for helping with ds/algo study

Opinionated timer. Available at [upvalue.github.com.io](/leettomato). Separates
design and coding phase and has a little self-grading component that can be
copied out to a spreadsheet for logging/time tracking purposes.

Quizzer. Currently under development. Is not publicly deployed because it uses
LLM APIs under the hood and would cause money if someone did shenanigans with
it. Lets you pick random problems and get graded on design only.
