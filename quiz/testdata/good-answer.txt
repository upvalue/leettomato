Use a hash map to store complements.

Approach:
1. Create an empty hash map
2. Iterate through the array with index i
3. For each number nums[i], compute complement = target - nums[i]
4. If complement exists in the hash map, return [hash_map[complement], i]
5. Otherwise, store nums[i] -> i in the hash map

Time complexity: O(n) - single pass through the array
Space complexity: O(n) - hash map stores at most n elements

This is optimal because we need to look at each element at least once.
